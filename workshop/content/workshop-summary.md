In this workshop you have seen how a Kubernetes operator and custom resources can be used to implement a mechanism which simplifies the deployment of Jupyter notebooks. This approach still requires having access to the Kubernetes cluster to deploy Jupyter notebooks, but would be useful to power users who are more technical than the typical Jupyter notebook user and would have access to the Kubernetes cluster for other reasons. It can also simplify the process for a cluster operator who needs to create Jupyter notebook deployments on an ad-hoc basis for users and where a dedicated service for providing access to Jupyter notebooks is not required.

The implementation of the Kubernetes operator provided here for deploying the Jupyter notebooks is a proof of concept only and is not available at this time separately as something you can install yourself into your own cluster. It exists purely as part of an exercise, embodied in these workshops, to explore options for deploying Jupyter notebooks.

In the next workshop in this series exploring deployment of Jupyter notebooks to Kubernetes, we will start to look at options for deploying Jupyter notebooks as a service using a dedicated application, where a user would not need access to the Kubernetes cluster.
